**under construction:** discrete events & development for network device simulation

## Introduction
This solultion will provide an extensible and highly configuralbe **discrete event simulator**. The current implementation of different simulators are supposed to realize a simulation for wireless sensor networks in a 3D environment.

The provided simulation models are shown in the following list The checked models are basically runnalbe or under development 
- [x] scene model
- [x] network model
- [x] antenna model
- [x] channel model (radio channel)
- [x] device model
- [ ] communication model
- [x] energy model
