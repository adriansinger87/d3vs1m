# d3vs1m
**under construction:** discrete events & development for network device simulation

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/adriansinger87/adriansinger87/_apis/build/status/adriansinger87.d3vs1m?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/adriansinger87/adriansinger87/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)

## Introduction
This solultion will provide an extensible and highly configuralbe **discrete event simulator**. The current implementation of different simulators are supposed to realize a simulation for wireless sensor networks in a 3D environment.

The provided simulation models are shown in the following list The checked models are basically runnalbe or under development 
- [x] scene model
- [x] network model
- [x] antenna model
- [x] channel model (radio channel)
- [x] device model
- [ ] communication model
- [x] energy model
 
## Development

**Visual Studio**

**VS Code**
